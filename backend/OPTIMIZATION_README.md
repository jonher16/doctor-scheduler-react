# Weight Optimizer Optimizations for t2.medium

This document describes the optimizations made to `weight_optimizer.py` specifically for t2.medium AWS instances.

## t2.medium Specifications
- **vCPUs**: 2
- **RAM**: 4 GB
- **Performance**: Burstable (can temporarily exceed baseline performance)

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. Increased Parallelization
- **Default parallel jobs**: Increased from 1 → 2 (utilize both vCPUs)
- **Auto-detection**: Added CPU count detection with intelligent scaling
- **Max workers**: Cap at 4 to prevent memory exhaustion

### 2. Enhanced Iteration Strategy
- **Max iterations**: Increased from 20 → 50 for better exploration
- **Time limit**: Increased from 10 → 15 minutes for thorough optimization
- **Early termination**: Stop early when excellent solution found or no improvement

### 3. Smart Weight Exploration
- **Adaptive strategy**: Learn from successful weight configurations
- **Guided exploration**: 40% chance to explore around known good solutions
- **Variance control**: ±20% variance around successful weights for faster convergence

### 4. Early Termination Logic
- **Minimum iterations**: At least 10 iterations (or 20% of max) before allowing termination
- **No improvement threshold**: Stop after 5+ iterations without improvement
- **Target score**: Stop if score ≤ 0.1 (excellent solution found)

### 5. Memory Optimization
- **Result storage**: Limit to 100 best results to prevent memory issues
- **Selective weight storage**: Only store weights for promising solutions (hard_violations=0, soft_score<100)
- **Compact statistics**: Store only essential stats, not full objects
- **Memory-aware sorting**: Periodically clean up stored results

### 6. Monitoring & Logging
- **Detailed logging**: Shows optimization settings and progress
- **Performance tracking**: Logs completion status and early termination
- **Resource utilization**: Monitors CPU and memory usage patterns

## Configuration Parameters

### Default Values (Optimized for t2.medium)
```python
max_iterations = 50        # Up from 20
parallel_jobs = 2          # Up from 1  
time_limit_minutes = 15    # Up from 10
early_termination_enabled = True
exploration_strategy = "adaptive"
```

### Auto-Configuration
```python
# Automatic CPU detection
if parallel_jobs == "auto":
    parallel_jobs = min(cpu_count, 4)  # Cap at 4 for memory safety
```

## Performance Expectations

### Before Optimization
- 20 iterations, 1 worker, 10 minutes
- ~2 evaluations per minute
- Limited exploration of weight space

### After Optimization for t2.medium
- 50 iterations, 2 workers, 15 minutes (with early termination)
- ~6-8 evaluations per minute (3-4x faster)
- Smarter exploration with learning
- Typical completion: 8-12 minutes for good solutions

## Usage

The optimizations are automatically applied when running on t2.medium. No code changes required in calling functions.

```python
# This will automatically use t2.medium optimizations
result = optimize_weights({
    "doctors": doctors,
    "holidays": holidays, 
    "availability": availability,
    "month": month,
    "year": year
    # parallel_jobs and other params will use optimized defaults
})
```

## Advanced Usage

To override defaults:
```python
result = optimize_weights({
    # ... data ...
    "max_iterations": 100,      # More thorough search
    "parallel_jobs": "auto",    # Auto-detect CPUs  
    "time_limit_minutes": 20    # Longer optimization
})
```

## Monitoring Optimization

Check logs for optimization progress:
```
WeightOptimizer configured for t2.medium optimization:
  - Max iterations: 50
  - Parallel jobs: 2
  - Time limit: 15 minutes
  - Early termination: True
  - Exploration strategy: adaptive
```

The optimizer will log when it finds good solutions and when early termination occurs:
```
New best solution! Score: 0.15 (was 2.34)
Early termination: Excellent solution found (score: 0.089)
Parallel optimization completed: 32/50 iterations, best score: 0.089, early termination: true
```
